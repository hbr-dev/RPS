# ‚úä Rock-Paper-Scissors Player Function

## üìñ Overview
This project implements a function called `player` in the file `RPS.py` to play the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The function is designed to respond strategically to the opponent's last move, enhancing the gameplay experience. The function takes a string input representing the opponent's last move and returns the next move to play.

## üéÆ Game Rules
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:
- Rock (R) crushes Scissors (S)
- Scissors (S) cuts Paper (P)
- Paper (P) covers Rock (R)

The objective is to choose a move that defeats the opponent's move.

## üîë Key Features
- **Dynamic Response:** The `player` function analyzes the opponent's last move to determine the best counter-move.
- **First Move Handling:** The function can handle the first game scenario by accepting an empty string as input, indicating no previous play.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This project is compatible with Python 3.x.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use the player function, follow these steps:

1. Open the RPS.py file.

2. Call the player function with the opponent's last move as an argument:

  ````python
  from RPS import player
  
  next_move = player("R")  # Example: Opponent played Rock
  print(next_move)  # This will print the next move

  ```python
  first_move = player("")  # No previous play
  print(first_move)  # This will print the initial move
  ```
